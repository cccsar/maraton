# **Competitive Programming**

*Competitive programming* repo. The story of my problems.

Some day this will be completely ordered. But for now only reckognizable things are: 
* basic
* graph
* dp
* uva
* contest
* doc
* miscellaneous

They clasify the problems they hold as you can see and have a pretty description in another .md. 

The convenion outside miscellaneous is to separate problems in *done* and *yet-to-do* which are kept in a some/todo dir.
Whenever a problem is to annoying that it has to be rewritten *f_i_* is prepended to the name to pay respects and indicate the number of the *i-th trial*.
